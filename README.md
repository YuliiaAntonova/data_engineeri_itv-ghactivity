Read data from files

Let us develop the code to read the data from files into Spark Dataframes.

Create directory for data and copy some files into it.
Create a Python program by name read.py. We will create a function by name from_files. It reads the data from files into Dataframe and returns it.
Call the program from app.py. For now review schema and data.
